# Plant Disease Detection
This project aims to develop a deep learning model that can accurately detect plant diseases from images. The model will be trained on a dataset of images of healthy and diseased plants. Once the model is trained, it will be able to predict the disease of a plant from a new image.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project is the PlantVillage dataset. This dataset contains over 54305 images of 38 different types of plants, each with multiple images of healthy and diseased leaves. The images are labeled with the type of plant and the disease, if any.

## Model
The model for this project will be a convolutional neural network (CNN). CNNs are well-suited for image classification tasks, as they can learn to identify patterns in images. The CNN will be trained using the transfer learning approach. This means that the CNN will be initialized with the weights of a pre-trained CNN. This will help the CNN to learn faster and achieve better performance.

## Training
The CNN will be trained for 10 epochs. Each epoch consists of training the CNN on a batch of images. The CNN will be evaluated on a validation set after each epoch. This will help to ensure that the CNN is not overfitting to the training data.

## Evaluation
The CNN will be evaluated on a test set of images. The test set will not be used for training the CNN. The CNN will be evaluated using the accuracy. The accuracy metric is the percentage of images that are correctly classified.

## Results
The CNN achieved an accuracy of 98% on the test set. This means that the CNN was able to correctly classify 92.5% of the images in the test set and loss of 31%.

## Conclusion
This project has developed a deep learning model that can accurately detect plant diseases from images. The model was trained on the PlantVillage dataset and achieved an accuracy of 92.5% on the test set. The model can be used to help farmers identify and treat plant diseases early, which can help to improve crop yields and reduce crop losses.

## Future Work
The future work for this project includes improving the accuracy of the model by training it on a larger dataset. The model can also be extended to detect diseases on other parts of plants, such as flowers and fruits. The model can also be used to develop a mobile app that farmers can use to identify plant diseases.
